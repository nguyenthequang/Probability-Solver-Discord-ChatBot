# Probability-Solver-Discord-ChatBot
A simple Discord chatbot that can solve simple probability problems

Overall, this is a very simple project that ultilizes my recently learned knowlegde of Discord Chatbot and my stats knowledge.
The main points of this project is to create something that can cut down the calculation required to solve a probability problem
and also a way for me to review my stats knowledge to prepare for a new academic year.

Aside from few random commands, most stats-related commands follow a common format:
!distribution_function parameters (Ex: !binom_prob 10 0.5 4)

distribution is binom, multinomial, norm, etc.

function is usually: prob(calculate multiple simple probs like F(X = 4)),
                     ci(confident interval for true means),
                     bounds(calculate F(x1 < X < x2) or simmilar),
                     extra(give E[X], Var, SD, etc.),
